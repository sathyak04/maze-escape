# Maze Escape 🎮

A procedurally generated **maze game** built with Pygame.  
Players navigate a dynamic maze, avoiding walls and racing to reach the finish.  
The game combines **classic maze-solving** with **interactive visuals, sounds, and algorithmic logic**, making each playthrough unique.

## 🚀 Features
- Randomized **DFS maze generation** using a **stack-based depth-first search**  
- **A\* pathfinding** to show optimal paths on demand  
- Smooth **player movement** with sliding animations  
- **Score tracking** and reset functionality  
- Visual and audio feedback using sprites and sound effects  
- Maze represented as a **2D grid graph**, showcasing traversal algorithms and neighbor checks  
- Demonstrates **graph and data structure concepts**:
  - 2D grid as an adjacency-like structure for the maze  
  - Stack for DFS maze generation  
  - Dictionaries and sets for A\* search

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python + Pygame** → Game logic, rendering, and audio  
- **Asyncio** → Smooth game loop and animation timing  
- **Heapq** → Priority queue for A\* pathfinding  
- **Graphs & Data Structures** → DFS, stacks, 2D grid representation, dictionaries, sets
